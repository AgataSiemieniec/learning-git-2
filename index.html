        <h3 class="title">Rudimental - These Days feat. Jess Glynne, Macklemore & Dan Caplen</h3><br>
        <p class="content">
            I know you moved onto someone new<br>
            Hope life is beautiful<br>
            You were the light for me to find my truth<br>
            I just wanna say, thank you<br>
            Leaving to find my soul<br>
            Told her I had to go<br>
            And I know it ain't pretty<br>
            When our hearts get broke<br>
            Too young to feel this old<br>
            Watching us both turn cold<br>
            Oh, I know it ain't pretty<br>
            When two hearts get broke<br>
            Yeah, I know it ain't pretty<br>
            When two hearts get broke<br><br>
            I hope someday<br>
            We'll sit down together<br>
            And laugh with each other<br>
            About these days, these days<br>
            All our troubles<br>
            We'll lay to rest<br>
            And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days<br>
            These days, these days<br>
            These days, these days<br><br>
            Three years of ups and downs<br>
            Nothing to show for it now<br>
            And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out<br>
            Calling me when I'm drunk, remind me of what I've done<br>
            And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah<br><br>
            I hope someday<br>
            We'll sit down together<br>
            And laugh with each other<br>
            About these days, these days<br>
            All our troubles<br>
            We'll lay to rest<br>
            And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days<br>
            Oh I know, I know<br>
            Oh I know, I know<br>
            Oh I know, I know<br>
            These days, these days<br>
            Oh I know, I know<br>
            Oh I know, I know<br>
            Oh I know, I know<br><br>
            To these days, these days<br>
            Cigarettes in the ash tray<br>
            Reminiscing on those past days<br>
            I thought you'd end up with my last name<br>
            But that changed<br>
            And I travelled around the world<br>
            Think where you living at now?<br>
            I heard you moved to Oxford<br>
            Got an apartment and settled down<br>
            And every once in a while<br>
            I start texting<br>
            Write a paragraph<br>
            But then I delete the message<br>
            Think 'bout you like a past time<br>
            I could cry you a river<br>
            Get you baptised or<br>
            I wasn't ready to act right<br>
            Used to always think I'd get you back, right<br>
            They say that things fall apart (yeah)<br>
            We were gonna move to Brooklyn<br>
            You were gonna study Art (oh no, oh)<br>
            Love is just a tool<br>
            To remind us who we are<br>
            And that we are not alone<br>
            When we're walking in the dark<br><br>
            I hope someday<br>
            We'll sit down together<br>
            And laugh with each other<br>
            About these days, these days<br>
            All our troubles<br>
            We'll lay to rest<br>
            And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days<br>
            We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days (these days, these days, these days)<br>
